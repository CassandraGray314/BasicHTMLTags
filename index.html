    <h1>How is Prework going?</h1>

    <p>I feel like I am running in a maze!</p>
    <p> It is fun but boy is this confusing!</p>
    <p> I feel confident for one second and frustrated the next!
    <P>I know that I will get better but for now I must be patient and trust the process.</P>
    </p>
     
    <h2> What I am excited For!</h2>
    <p>I can wait till things make more sense to me.</p>
    <p>I am realistic and I know coding might not ever be easy.</p>
    <p>I can wait to get the Prework done so I can start class!<p>
    </p> But I really can't wait to graduate!<p>
     
    <h3> What I need to do to compelte Prework?</h3>   
    <ul><li>I must stay focused!</li>
         <li> I have to believe that I can do the work.</li>
        <li> I have to be patient with myself and ask for help when I need it.</li> </ul>
